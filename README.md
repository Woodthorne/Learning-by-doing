# Learning by doing
This repository is made to host various assignments and tasks I do as part of my python programming education. It is made so that I can share my code with classmates or others who are learning similar things as examples of how I approach a problem. It is also made to show of to my family (Hi dad!) who are eager to see my personal growth.

While I endeavour to make everything readable in english, some things might start of with swedish text.

## Table of contents
* Basic Python: Various exercises done as part of a school course.
    * Python√∂vningar(num): All exercises done as part of the course. Initial upload in swedish. Translation into english is unlikely unless specifically asked for, as I want to preserve this code as much as possible.
* Databases: Various exercises done as part of a school course. Features text files with the input given to DBeaver when interacting with the Northwind database.
